Monte Carlo Tree Search
=======================

This is an implementation of an AI in Python using the UCT Monte Carlo
Tree Search algorithm.

The Monte Carlo Tree Search AIs included here are designed to work
with `jbradberry/boardgame-socketserver
<https://github.com/jbradberry/boardgame-socketserver>`_ and
`jbradberry/boardgame-socketplayer
<https://github.com/jbradberry/boardgame-socketplayer>`_.


Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7, 3.5+; PyPy; PyPy3
* six


Getting Started
---------------

To set up your local environment you should create a virtualenv and
install everything into it. ::

    $ mkvirtualenv mcts

Pip install this repo, either from a local copy, ::

    $ pip install -e mcts

or from github, ::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/jbradberry/mcts#egg=mcts

Additionally, you will need to have `jbradberry/boardgame-socketplayer
<https://github.com/jbradberry/boardgame-socketplayer>`_ installed in
order to make use of the players.

This project currently comes with two different Monte Carlo Tree
Search players.  The first, ``jrb.mcts.uct``, uses the count of the
number of wins for a node to make its decisions.  The second,
``jrb.mcts.uctv`` instead keeps track of the evaluated value of the
board for the playouts from a given node ::

    $ board-play.py t3 jrb.mcts.uct    # number of wins metric
    $ board-play.py t3 jrb.mcts.uctv   # point value of the board metric

These AI players can also take additional arguments:

time (default: 30)
  The amount of thinking time allowed for the AI to make its decision,
  in seconds.  Ex: ``$ board-play.py t3 jrb.mcts.uct -e time=5``

max_actions (default: 1000)
  The maximum number of actions, or plays, to allow in one of the
  simulated playouts before giving up.  Ex: ``$ board-play.py t3
  jrb.mcts.uct -e max_actions=500``

C (default: 1.4)
  The exploration vs. exploitation coefficient at the heart of the UCT
  algorithm.  Larger values prioritize exploring inadequately covered
  actions from a node, smaller values prioritize exploiting known
  higher valued actions.  Experimentation with this variable to find
  reasonable values for a given game is recommended.  Ex: ``$
  board-play.py t3 jrb.mcts.uct -e C=3.5``

The ``-e`` flag may be used multiple times to set additional
variables.
